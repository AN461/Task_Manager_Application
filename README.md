# Task Manager Application Using Python

### Description
The Task Manager Application is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks easily, with the added functionality of tracking time remaining until task deadlines.


## Tech Stack

- Python: The core programming language used for building the application logic.
- Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python used to create the graphical user interface.
- tkcalendar: A Python library used to include a date entry widget for selecting due dates.
- datetime: A module in Python used to manipulate dates and times efficiently.

## Key Features

1. Add Task: Users can add tasks to the application by providing a title, description, and due date.
2. View Task Details: The application displays all added tasks with their respective details, including title, description, and due date.
3. Remove Task: Users can remove tasks from the application when they are completed or no longer relevant.
4. Time Remaining Countdown: The application dynamically calculates and displays the time remaining until the due date for each task, updating in real-time.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The application features a clean and intuitive interface built using the Tkinter library, ensuring ease of use for all users.


## How it Works

1. Users input task details such as title, description, and due date into the designated fields in the application.
2. Upon adding a task, the application dynamically creates a task box displaying the task details and initiates a countdown timer for the due date.
3. Users can view all added tasks in the application window and remove tasks as needed.
4. The countdown timer continuously updates in real-time, providing users with accurate information on the time remaining until task deadlines.
